1. create payment account // by default test mode
2. goto setting (by clicking setting icon)
  2.1 Account Details, Branding (change payment view color logo)
3. Developer -> API Key
 3.1 Publishable Key //frontend
 3.2 Secret key // backend

4. For secure the success url.
  4.1 Developer > webhooks > add endpoint //original url > add event //checkout.session.completed
  important: implement the post route before json middleware
  
  note: And then go here to developers, then choose webhooks,
  and here, add a new endpoint.
  Now what is this endpoint here and this webhook?
  Basically we're gonna specify a URL here
  to which Stripe will automatically send a POST request to
  whenever a checkout session has successfully completed,
  so basically whenever a payment was successful.
  With that POST request, Stripe will then send back
  the original session data that we created in the first step
  when we created that checkout session.
  That's the reason why we actually needed our website
  to be deployed here because now we need to specify
  that real-life URL here.
